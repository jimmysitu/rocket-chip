Jimmy, I try to run rocket-chip with cvc, but it seems there is compile error with cvc(700c, download from http://www.tachyon-da.com, 04/06/2018).

This compile error seem cause by the generated design code by firrtl, and cannot be easily fixed.
I suggest we try iverilog with VPI instead, see isim dir
